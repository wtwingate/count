In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and
without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life
was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
comprehended it not.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The same came for a
witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the
true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the
world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto
his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them
gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of
grace and truth.

John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He
that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me. And of his
fulness have all we received, and grace for grace. For the law was given by
Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any
time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
declared him.
